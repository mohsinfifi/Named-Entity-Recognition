# Named-Entity-Recognition


Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more. It is a crucial component in many NLP applications, such as information extraction, question answering, and sentiment analysis. NER can be done using machine learning, and one of the popular approaches is to use Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and libraries like spaCy in Python
